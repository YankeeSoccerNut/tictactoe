# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview:
The classic Tic Tac Toe game.


**Features:**
* 1 or 2 players
* Extendable to 13 rows and columns
* Simple "AI".  The computer simply chooses the next available square.  Turns out that adding intelligence is really difficult!
* A verbal nod to one of my favorite movies at the beginning of play
